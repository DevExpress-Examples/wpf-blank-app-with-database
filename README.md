You can use this example to create your own DevExpress projects and explore our features.

We used this project to create a getting started example for the WPF Data Grid. You can find this example at [https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/wpf-dxgrid-getting-started](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/wpf-dxgrid-getting-started).

Refer to the following topic for information on how to connect your project to a database: [https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/115149/scaffolding-wizard/data-access-layer/how-to-generate-data-access-layer-with-entity-framework-database-first](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/115149/scaffolding-wizard/data-access-layer/how-to-generate-data-access-layer-with-entity-framework-database-first).
